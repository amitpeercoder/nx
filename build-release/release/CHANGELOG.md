- **Platform Security**: Removed hardcoded paths and improved cross-platform security

#### Security Improvements
- Safe process execution using `posix_spawn()` alternatives
- Input validation framework in TUI editor
- Secure temporary file handling with O_TMPFILE
- Memory safety improvements and bounds checking

### Performance

#### Achieved Targets
- Note operations: <50ms for typical operations
- Search queries: <200ms with FTS5 indexing  
- Large file support: 1GB+ files with virtual scrolling
- Memory efficiency: <100MB for typical operations
- Full reindex: <45s on mid-range laptop

### Changed

#### Architecture Improvements
- Refactored Application class from god object to clean DI pattern
- Separated service management into dedicated container system
- Improved error handling consistency across all modules
- Enhanced cross-platform compatibility
- Tags panel now auto-grows to fill available space
- Improved tag navigation with automatic scrolling
- Updated help documentation with AI features

### Fixed

#### Critical Issues Resolved
- All security vulnerabilities identified in architectural review
- Cross-platform path handling issues
- Memory safety concerns in editor operations
- Unicode handling edge cases
- Build system portability issues

### Fixed
- Tags list scrolling and space utilization
- Panel resizing with minimum width constraints
- Tag display truncation for long tag lists
