- Ensure all operations are atomic and safe
- Preserve the local-first philosophy

### **Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for all new commands
- Integration tests for workflows

- Manual testing of TUI integration

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Implement backup/restore early
- Extensive testing with real note collections
- Gradual rollout of breaking changes
- Clear migration paths for users
